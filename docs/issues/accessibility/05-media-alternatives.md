# Provide Captions, Transcripts, and Media Alternatives

## Context
Multimedia content must include captions or transcripts to meet WCAG 1.2.x and Google’s accessibility recommendations. Existing onboarding, instructional, or AI feedback videos need alternative formats so users with hearing impairments can access the information.

## Tasks
- Add captions (VTT or equivalent) to instructional/onboarding videos distributed through the product or documentation.
- Provide transcripts or written summaries for AI feedback clips and other audio/video learning content.
- Document a “media accessibility” checklist for new multimedia assets to ensure future compliance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Each embedded video either includes captions or has a documented plan with owner/date for delivering them.
- Audio-only content (if any) links to a transcript or equivalent textual alternative.
- Lighthouse/axe reports no unmet media alternative requirements.
